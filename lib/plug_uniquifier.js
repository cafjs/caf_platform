/*
 This module relies on Cloud Foundry style http routing, i.e.,:
 there could be several DEAs (Droplet Execution Agents) (i.e., node.js
processes) that could fulfill an application request. Each DEA is identified
by a hostname/port  pair. Routing is based on the url (that identifies the
application) and an optional VCAP  cookie that contains the destination DEA
host/port (encrypted). When there is no cookie CF selects  one destination at
random from a set of DEAs hosting that application. If the VCAP  cookie is
present it decrypts it and tries to use it as its destination; if it fails it
defaults to the randomized strategy. If the node.js application response has
a jsessionid cookie, CF will respect that session by setting the VCAP cookie
to that node host/port, i.e., all future requests in that session (assuming no
failures) will be routed to that DEA.


 Our strategy to guarantee uniqueness of CAs in this context is as follows:

 First, within a single node.js process we just maintain a consistent directory
(plug_lookup) that is used to route all local requests.

 Second, at a global level we use a lease-based directory for binding (unique)
CA ids to DEAs (encrypted cookies with host/port). If a node fails it stops
renewing the lease and the binding eventually dissapears, allowing another
node to take over that CA.

 Third, the checkpointing service  always ensures that nobody else has the lease
before commiting permanent state changes on behalf of a CA. Otherwise, the CA
will shut down and its entry in the local directory will get deleted.
We always checkpoint before externalizing any changes and this guarantees
serializability.

There are a few complications:

 - At start-up a node does not know its own VCAP cookie because cookies are
encrypted by CF. Therefore, it cannot safely commit state changes until it
discovers its VCAP cookie. To discover  it  we force our first client to
retry after we set a random session cookie. This forces CF to attach our VCAP
to the response, and the new request will be routed back to this node with
both cookies. If the random session cookie matches we have a greater
confidence that it is our own VCAP and not the one of other failed (and
randomly routed) request.

- If there is a node failure the system will keep on retrying until
the lease expires and each retry will get randomly routed to a different DEA.
To avoid wasting resources either clients should throttle retries and/or the
lease timeout should be small.

-If there is a CA failure we rely on the node process to fix the problem (i.e.,
 shut it down and recreate it from a checkpoint) so retries will be routed to
 the same node. However, if a node process cannot fix the problem (i.e.,
cannnot access the checkpointing service) it should exit to enable the request
 to be routed to a different node by CF.

-We want to eliminate performance hot spots by migrating CAs to other nodes.
The strategy is to just kill the node process and allow its CAs to be
randomly spread to other nodes after leases expire. Again, this could create
busy transients due to failed retries...
